# Security Policy

This project is all about security. I want to provide a good, but also secure usage experience. All security issues should be reported as fast as possible and are always the main focus of this project.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a vulnerability, reporting it is simple and should be done as fast as possible. 
First, create an issue and describe the vulnerability in detail. Remember to include the "Security" flag/tag to your issue and you should get a response THE SAME DAY.
